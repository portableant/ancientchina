<h3>First mention of iron casting</h3>

<p>China was the first country in the world to develop iron casting, which is first mentioned in 513 B.C. The types of clay found in China are especially good for using in <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/b/blast.html','blas')">blast-furnaces</a>.  The Chinese also knew how to reduce the melting point of iron by adding in iron phosphate.</p>

The invention of <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/c/cast.html','cast')">cast</a> iron meant great improvements in other areas of Chinese life. Iron ploughs could cut through very heavy and waterlogged soil. Lands that were previously not suitable for agriculture were now able to be used for growing food.
