<h3>Last Emperor Puyi gains throne</h3>

<p>In 1908, the last Qing emperor, Puyi, became Emperor at the age of the three.  He was only to rule for three years. In 1911 revolutionaries formed a <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/r/republican.html','repu')">Republican</a> government and forced him to stand down.</p>

<p>His <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/a/abdication.html','site')">abdication</a> brought the two thousand year old Chinese empire to an end.</p>

<p>In 1911 the revolutionaries declared a <a href="javascript:openGlos('../../glossary/p/provisional.html','prov')">Provisional</a> Republican government. However, the revolutionaries were still weak.  For the next twenty years China was virtually ruled by a number of warlords.  No single power was strong enough to take control.  This meant that Japan was able to easily invade China in 1931.</p>
